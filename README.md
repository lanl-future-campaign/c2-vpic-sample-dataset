This sample dataset is generated by running open source VPIC particle simulation code using a single process on a single node with result post-processed to transform local particle locations in a cell to global coordinates (X, Y, Z) while pre-calculating particle energies and storing them with the dataset. A total of 131,072 ions and 131,072 electrons were simulated and recorded.

A modified https://github.com/lanl/vpic/blob/master/sample/harris input deck was run. The simulation had 480 timesteps. Particle (both ions and electrons) state was saved every 24 timesteps. The initial particle state (timestep 0) can be recovered by reading `iparticle.0.0.bin` and `eparticle.0.0.bin`. The final particle state (timestep 480) can be read from `iparticle.480.0.bin` and `eparticle.480.bin`. Each such particle file has 131,072 particles and is 6MB large. There are 42 particle files in total (21 for each type of particle).

Particles are 48 bytes each. Each particle has 9 fields. Both particle types share the same schema shown below. Particles are written to files as-is (48 bytes by 48 bytes) with no encoding or compression. There is also no headers or footers in a particle file.

# Particle Schema (48 bytes each)

```
8 bytes uint64_t particle_id
8 bytes uint64_t padding
4 bytes float    x              location of particle in X direction
4 bytes float    y              location of particle in Y direction
4 bytes float    z              location of particle in Z direction
4 bytes float    i              index of the cell that had the particle
4 bytes float    ux             momentum of particle in X direction
4 bytes float    uy             momentum of particle in Y direction
4 bytes float    uz             momentum of particle in Z direction
4 bytes float    ke             kinetic energy of particle
