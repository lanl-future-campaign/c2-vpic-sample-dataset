This sample dataset is generated by running open source VPIC particle simulation code using a single process on a single node with result post-processed to transform local particle locations in a cell to global coordinates (X, Y, Z) while pre-calculating particle energies and storing them with the dataset. A total of 131,072 ions and 131,072 electrons were simulated and recorded.

A modified https://github.com/lanl/vpic/blob/master/sample/harris input deck was run. The resulting simulation had 480 timesteps. Simulation state was saved every 24 timesteps. The initial state (timestep 0) was recorded in `iparticle.0.0.bin` and `eparticle.0.0.bin`. The final state (timestep 480) was recorded in `iparticle.480.0.bin` and `eparticle.480.bin`. There are a total of 21 such file pairs. Each stores the state of 131,072 ions and the state of 131,072 electrons at a specific simulation timestep ranging from 0 to 480. Ions are stored in `iparticle` files. Electrons are stored on `eparticle` files. There are 42 files in total. Each file is 6MB in size.

Particles are 48 bytes each. Each particle has 9 fields. Both particle types share the same schema shown below. Particles are written to files one by one (48 bytes by 48 bytes) in a binary form with no encoding or compression. There is no headers or footers in a particle file.

# Particle Schema (48 bytes per particle)

```
8 bytes uint64_t particle_id
8 bytes uint64_t padding
4 bytes float    x              location of particle in X direction
4 bytes float    y              location of particle in Y direction
4 bytes float    z              location of particle in Z direction
4 bytes float    i              index of the cell that had the particle
4 bytes float    ux             momentum of particle in X direction
4 bytes float    uy             momentum of particle in Y direction
4 bytes float    uz             momentum of particle in Z direction
4 bytes float    ke             kinetic energy of particle
